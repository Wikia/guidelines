## Contributing to the Guidelines

If you'd like to update the guidelines, please submit a PR and tag @wikia/cake. Also mention it in the #cake-team-tech slack channel. 

Pull requests should contain a description of the new guideline and a date by which all feedback should be given. Pull requests can be merged on that date as long as: 
* At least one person has approved the PR or added an "LGTM" (looks good to me) comment
* All requests for change have been addressed and/or all parties have agreed to disagree.
* If there are differences in opinion, the majority rules. 

## Updating legacy code to reflect new guidelines

This can be done in a number of ways.

### Clean up as you go
It is important that we take the opportunity to refactor code that doesn't meet our guidelines as we see it in the code base. If a PR has gotten too large or you're running out of time, it's okay to leave legacy code as is. Please use your best judgement.

### Create a ticket to do a sweeping change
It can be a boon to productivity to have the entire code base adhere to a certain guideline. If you think this might be the case, please create a ticket and let the product owner know, even if we don't get to it right away.
