# Introduction

This document describes the consul usage and service discovery guidelines. It
should be considered a work in progress that will evolve as we gain more
experience with running consul in production. If you have any questions please
use the Wikia #consul chat channel.

## Introduction to Consul and Service Discovery

For an introduction to consul please read the [documentation
provided](https://www.consul.io/intro/) by the creators of consul.

Services can be "discovered" via DNS or the HTTP API. As an example, consider a
query for a discussion service node. When using the DNS interface one would
query for `discussion.service.sjc.consul`. Below is an example:

```
dig @localhost -p 8600 prod.discussion.service.sjc.consul
```

The answer section of the above query will provide the IP addresses of instances
that have registered themselves as `discussion` "services", have the tag
"prod", and are healthy.

If you want to also query for the port that the service is listening one
add `SRV` to the end of the above `dig` query.

Consul DNS addresses take the form `TAG.SERVICE.service.DATACENTER.consul`.

A similar request for "healthy" instances of the discussion service could query
the HTTP API using the following:

```
curl 'http://consul.service.sjc.consul:8500/v1/health/service/discussion?passing&tag=prod'
```

The `passing` query parameter will limit the output to "healthy" services. The
`tag` parameter can be used to filter by a tag.

# Guidelines

## Configuration Schema

In this section DNS is used for illustration purposes. However, the guidelines
apply generally for all services configured in consul.

### `TAG`

Tags are reserved for attributes that are specific to a set of registered
instances of a service.

Services should expose at least one tag and clients of that service should
*ALWAYS* use that tag when requesting the service. For example, to query the
production discussion service you would use
`prod.discussion.service.consul`.

To specify the environment, services will use the `prod` tag for production
and the `dev` tag for development.

**`DATABASES`**

Databases expose additional tags: `slave`, `master` as well as their combination 
with environment, i.e. `slave-prod`, `master-prod`, `slave-dev`, `master-dev`.
When addressing a DB as service, the combined tag should be used to ensure
reads and writes are happening on proper instances.

### `SERVICE`

Service names should be descriptive and consistent with the deployed instances
of the service. For example, if the service is called `user-preference` then the
`SERVICE` portion of the address should be `user-preference`.

Service dependencies (e.g. a database cluster) should use the form
`TAG.{type}-{service}` where `{type}` is a string that clearly defines the
dependency provided by the service. For example the database cluster (shortened
to `db`) used by the discussion service would be identified by
`prod.db-discussion.service.consul` ( please keep in mind that master / slaves 
in this case need to be identified by `master-prod.db-discussion.service.consul` 
and `slave-prod.db-discussion.service.consul` respectively )


### `DATACENTER` and Environment

The `DATACENTER` portion of the consul address referrers to the _physical_
datacenter where the service resides. There may _not_ be a 1:1 relationship
between `DATACENTER` and environment.

Note also that the `DATACENTER` portion of an address can also be omitted.
The datacenter defaults to the location where the local consul agent is bound.

In practice the `DATACENTER` should normally be omitted to ensure that requests
are contained within the same datacenter where the running service.

### Service Registries

Service registries should be provided using the [consul key
value data](https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/kv.html). For example,
to create a registry of services to be included in the
[API gateway](https://github.com/Wikia/api-gateway) the following key-value tree
should be created:

```
/DATACENTER/kv/registry/prod/api-gateway
  discussion => prod.discussion
  user-preference => prod.user-preference
  auth => prod.helios
  ...
```

In production environments there should be one *and only one* entry per service.
Aliases are ok (see the `auth` entry above).

*Production environments should never reference development services.*

In a development environment this might look like the following:

```
/DATACENTER/kv/registry/dev/api-gateway
  discussion => dev.discussion
  artur-helios => artur.helios          # a dev box registered for the service
```

In environments other than production the restriction of one entry per service
can be relaxed.

*Development environments should never reference production services.*

The API gateway gateway can then traverse this tree to create mappings between
the service names and the physical `address:port` tuples that identify each
instance in the desired environment.

#### Internal-only Resources

If a service needs to separate internal and external resources they can do so by
running a server on a separate port and registering it explicitly with consul
using the `private.prod` tag (as an example).
